# Description
Many Weather forecasting systems aim to provide weather information on local machines without thorough details of visibility, humidity percentage and air pressure levels or hourly intervals.
This project provides personal experience for registered and unregistered users, facilitating all means and accessibility to the website itself, by considering the provision of reliable and accurate weather forecasts hourly, daily, and weekly. As well as maintaining the ease of navigation throughout the system. In addition, the system should be able to provide weather information for multiple locations at the same time by keeping a list of favorite locations to enhance user experience.
